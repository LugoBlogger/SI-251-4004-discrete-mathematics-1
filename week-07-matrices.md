# Week 07 - Matrices

## Motivation

## Introduction

- Definition of matrix
  - $r$-th row of a matrix
  - $j$-th column of a matrix
  - $(i, j)$ element or entry of a matrix
  - notation
- Square matrix
- Two matrices are equal

**Definition**     
A _matrix_ is a rectangular array of numbers. A matrix with $m$ rows 
and $n$ columns is called an $m \times n$ matrix. The plural of matrix is
_matrices_. A matrix with the same number of rows as columns is called
_square_. Two matrices are _equal_ if they have the same number of rows and
the same number of columns and the corresponding entries in every
position are equal.

**Example 1**    
The matrix $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \\ 1 & 3 \end{pmatrix}$  is 
a $3 \times 2$ matrix.

- Special matrices: identity matrix, zero matrix, one matrix

## Matrix Arithmetic

- sum
- product

## Transpose and Powers of Matrices

**Definition**    
Let $\mathbf{A} = [a_{i,j}]$ be an $m \times n$ matrix. The _transpose_ of $\mathbf{A}$, 
denoted by $\mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T}$, is the $n \times m$ matrix obtained by interchanging
the rows and columns of $\mathbf{A}$. In other words, if $\mathbf{A}^\mathsf{T} = [b_{i,j}]$,
then $b_{i,j} = a_{j,i}$ for $i = 11, 2, \ldots, n$ and $j = 1, 2, \ldots, m$.
