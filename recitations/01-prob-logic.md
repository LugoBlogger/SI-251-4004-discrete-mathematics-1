## Problem 20

The **dual** of a compound proposition that contains only the logical operators
$\vee$, $\wedge$, and $\neg$, is the compound proposition obtained by replacing 
each $\vee$ by $\wedge$, each $\wedge$ by $\vee$, each $\mathbf{T}$ by $\mathbf{F}$, 
and each $\mathbf{F}$ by $\mathbf{T}$. The dual of a compound proposition $s$
is denoted by $s^*$.
